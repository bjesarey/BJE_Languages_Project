<h2>Basic information</h2>
<p>Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995 because he wanted to create a language that <q>was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python.</q> Ruby has had over three versions, with the newest version running three times faster than its predecessors with the help of <em>just in time compilation</em>. In Ruby, <strong>everything is object-oriented,</strong> meaning parts of the language can be changed to fit the need of the user. Ruby is used for web development, static site generation, automation, building web servers, and data processing. Thanks to Ruby on Rails, which is a Ruby written framework for building websites, multiple well known applications have been built, including but not limited to: GitHub, Hulu, and Airbnb.</p>
