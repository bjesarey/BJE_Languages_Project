<h2>Basic information</h2>
<p>Rust was created by Graydon Hoare in 2015 as part of a Mozilla sponsored project to rebuild their browser stack, which was running on C++ at the time. During the development of Rust, the garbage collector was removed because of improvements made in its memory management system. Without the garbage collector, Rust programs could now run much faster. Rust was made with high performance and memory safety in mind and has experienced rapid adoption by software companies as a result. Companies incorporating Rust into their programs include Amazon, Facebook(Meta), and Microsoft.</p>
