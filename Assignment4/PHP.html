<h2>Basic information</h2>
<p>The first version of PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf <strong>in 1993, but was not released to the public until 1995.</strong> PHP has had over eight versions, with each update adding new syntax and bug fixes. PHP is most often used for server-side scripting, command line scripting, and writing desktop applications. The syntax of PHP is similar to HTML and is <em>not case sensitive</em>, so knowledge of HTML would be recommended for learning PHP. In fact, PHP programs can be written inside an HTML script. Although PHP is beginning to decline in popularity, it is still used by some of the most well known websites, such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and Etsy.</p>
