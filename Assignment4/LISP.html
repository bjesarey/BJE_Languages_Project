<h2>Basic information</h2>
<p>LISP was created by John McCarthy in 1958. It is the second oldest high-level programming language next to Fortran. Several concepts introduced in LISP would become staples in nearly every high-level programming language after it, such as recursion, garbage collection, and function types. LISP is used to develop artificial intelligence programs, but subsets of LISP would be created as a general purpose form of LISP, such as Common LISP in 1984.</p>
